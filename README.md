# RouterVpnManager
I Have a DD-WRT router and an apple TV i want to be able to control what vpn my router is connect to from my apple tv.
just to play around  and see if I can accomplish this. 
I can get python to run to run in DD-WRT so I'm using that as a backend and a C# Xamarin Front end. 
I'm going to start small with a C# test client and a C# clientLibrary to get the ball rolling
