Things that you may (probably) will need to do to get this god dam thing working
I recommend you follow these steps otherwise it might not work + it will save you alot of headach
Also I'm not responsible in the unlikely event you mess something up. Continue at your own risk. You have been warned

The Basics (I'm going to assume you have already done this / know how to do this i've provide to info. Do a bit of research before installing)
 - Install DD-WRT https://wiki.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Firmware_FAQ#Where_do_I_download_firmware.3F 
 - Install Entware https://wiki.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Installing_Entware



Install RouterVpnManager
Once you install entware you should have a opt folder 
 - Enable SSH (probably already have if you installed Entware)
 - Install python & screen though Entware using opkg install command
 - copy paste RouterVpnManager folder containing the python (you can use filezilla)(Path should be /opt/RouterVpnManager)
 - inside this folder you should have a few things
   - The actual python
   - start.sh script (still will launch the script in a screen)
	 - You will need to go in here an modify the setting for your particular setup
 - Grab some .opvn from the vpn of your choice (I Use Expressvpn so there may be some additional steps for you)
 - you will need to make a seperate auth file to store your login details
  - You will have to open each .opvn file and add "auth-user-pass" with the path to the auth file (other wise it will prompt you for a password which is no good)
