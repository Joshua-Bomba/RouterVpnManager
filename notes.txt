Things that you may (probably) will need to do to get this god dam thing working

What will you need:
Install DD-WRT & enable SSH
connect to the router and
Install Entware
install python though Entware using opkg install command

Once you install entware you should have a opt folder inside there create a new folder 
place The RouterVpnManager.py script in there (you can use filezilla or )
Grab some .opvn from the vpn of your choice
before copying them over there are a few modifications you will need to make
 - you will need to make a seperate auth file to store your login details
   - You will have to open each .opvn file and add "auth-user-pass" with the path to the auth file
 -
